# smartOrb

A neat personal project to toggle a [LIFX](https://www.lifx.com) light on/off whenever a mac computer wake/goes to sleep.

Uses the [LIFX HTTP REST API](https://api.developer.lifx.com). To use, create a swift file with a static string variable called `apiToken` with your LIFX API Token as its value.

The app features a slider to control brightness levels, as well as the options to manually toggle the light on and off.
